#Wikitxt is a lightweight markup language and a tool for composing #Wiki . The syntax of #Wikitxt can be converted to #HTML and viewed in a browser. When converted to HTML, files can be interlinked.

#Wikitxt is based on the format of lists and paragraphs. Most information can be expressed in list format, and the choice between lists and paragraphs is always changing as you write.

Text decoration is limited to mutual links using hashtags. By utilizing the decoration of mutual links, you can intentionally increase the number of pages in the wiki.

In summary, it's like this:

  Lists
    Based on the idea that most information can be expressed in lists
  Paragraphs
    Paragraphs always have the potential to be listed. They can easily be converted to lists.
    Paragraphs can also serve as headings.
  Mutual Links
    Text decoration is limited to links.
    Words you want to emphasize should be expressed as wiki pages.

Absolute url is parsed as external link: #<https://example.com Example Domain>
